# Advanced Machine Learning course

This is my github repo for the AML specialisation offered by Yandex on coursera. 

## Modules
1. [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/) . The course covers the fundamentals of Deep Learning, from the basic ideas of overfitting and underfitting to state of the art CNN and RNN.
	
	- During the course, I coded a neural network in numpy which 	helped me understand how backprop really works. 
		
	- The assignments are open ended, encouraging experimentation and trial and error, as it would be the case in a real world application.
		
	- The assignments have an interesting blend of numpy, keras, and tensorflow. This helps to think of these modules as tools in the same toolbox instead of isolated tools.
		
	- The final project is designing a **captioning neural network**, featuring both a CNN for feature extraction (Pretrained InceptionV3) and an RNN. It is trained on a set of (images, captions) and the network learns to caption any image (that resembles the training set, that is)
